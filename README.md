# flipbase

Since the release of the Z Flip5, it's now possible to create custom widgets on the coverscreen !

This project is a base for creating your own widgets, it works by adding a `samsung_widget_cover_info.xml` file containing the coverscreen widget information to your app. This file is referenced as metadata of the widget receiver in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
